# Genesys RPG Adversary Builder

Create, maintain, and update adversaries for the [Genesys RPG](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/genesys/).  Adversaries are stored in a plain text file that might look like this:

    MINION Gang Heavy : Tough Person, Dodgy, Criminal Tough

The result would be a combination of the packages *Tough Person,* *Dodgy,* and *Criminal Tough* as defined in the [Genesys Expanded Player's Guide](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/298208/Genesys-Expanded-Players-Guide)
